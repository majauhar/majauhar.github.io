# Introduction

In light of current events, it is essential that diplomacy takes its path to maintain peace all over the world. United Nations is the only global platform for such discussions. In this tutorial, we would simulate the discussion around current Israel/US - Iran conflict, where some of the member states would put forth their view on the situation, along with Iran, in order to work out a diplomatic solution.

## About United Nations and Model UN (MUN)

The United Nations (UN) is an international organization founded in 1945 to maintain peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, and promote social progress. Model United Nations (MUN) is an educational simulation where students learn about diplomacy, international relations, and the UN by representing different countries and attempting to solve real-world issues.

## About Multi-Agent Systems

Multi-agent systems (MAS) are computerized systems composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents within an environment. These systems are used to solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent to solve.

## About CAMEL-AI Framework

CAMEL (Communicative Agents for "Mind" Exploration of Large Language Model Society) is an open-source library designed to study the behaviors and capabilities of AI agents in multi-agent settings. It provides tools for creating, managing, and observing interactions between AI agents with different roles and objectives.

# Tutorial: Simulating a UN Session with CAMEL

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- CAMEL-AI library (`pip install camel-ai`)
- OpenAI API key (set in environment variables)
- python-dotenv (`pip install python-dotenv`)

## Step 1: Set Up Environment

```python
import textwrap
from camel.agents import ChatAgent
from camel.messages import BaseMessage
from camel.models import ModelFactory
from camel.tasks import Task
from camel.toolkits import FunctionTool, SearchToolkit
from camel.types import ModelPlatformType, ModelType
from camel.societies.workforce import Workforce
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()  # Load environment variables (including OpenAI API key)
```

## **Step 2: Create Helper Function for Country Representatives**

```python
def make_rep(
    country: str,
    positions: str,
) -> ChatAgent:
    msg_content = textwrap.dedent(
        f"""
        You are the UN representative of {country}
        You must remain rooted to the positions: {positions} of your country.
        You should negotiate in good faith and uphold diplomatic standards.
        """
    )
    sys_msg = BaseMessage.make_assistant_message(
        role_name="Country Representative to the UN",
        content=msg_content,
    )

    model = ModelFactory.create(
        model_platform=ModelPlatformType.OPENAI,
        model_type=ModelType.GPT_4O,
    )

    agent = ChatAgent(
        system_message=sys_msg,
        model=model,
        tools=[FunctionTool(SearchToolkit().search_duckduckgo)],
    )
    return agent
```

## **Step 3: Define the Conflict Context**

```python
context = textwrap.dedent(
    """
    Israel and the United States have bombed nuclear and military facilities in Iran.
    Iran has retaliated with missile strikes on Israeli facilities and US airbase in Qatar.
    Iran has further accused IAEA, a UN body, for leaking out details of Iranian nuclear facilities.
    Iran has formally started the process of restricting IAEA access to the nuclear facilities.
    IAEA says that this poses threats to the non-proliferation treaty (NPT).
    Iran expresses security concerns.
    Israel cites security reasons for its attacks.
    Israel, however, is non-party to NPT and is known to possess numerous nuclear warheads.
    """
)
```

## **Step 4: Define Country Positions**

Create position statements for each country (Russia, China, US, France, UK, Iran) following the pattern:

```python
russian_position = textwrap.dedent(
    """
    1. Israel's attack on Iran violates international law.
    2. Israel's attack on Iran's nuclear facilities violate UN charters.
    3. Israel and Iran should hold talks for a ceasefire.
    4. US bombing violates Iranian sovereignty.
    5. Calls for diplomacy rather than military action.
    """
)
# Similar for other countries...
```

## **Step 5: Create the UN Coordinator Agent**

```python
persona = "You are the coordinator at the UN forum. You represent the United Nations and are an unbiased and neutral party to any discussion."
    
procedure = textwrap.dedent(
    f"""
    1. Ask each country representative to present their topics.
    2. Call for moderated discussions for each topic.
    3. Facilitate open discussions between representatives.
    4. Request groups to present their resolutions.
    5. Allow amendments or modifications.
    6. Have representatives vote (Yes/No/Abstain).
    7. Present resolutions and voting results.
    8. Provide summary and outcome.
    9. Present closing remarks.
    """
)

coordinator_msg_content = textwrap.dedent(
    f"""
    {persona}
    As a coordinator, you have to coordinate the session. You have to follow the following stages, one after another, strictly in order:
    {procedure}
    """
)

sys_msg = BaseMessage.make_assistant_message(
    role_name="Session coordinator of the UN",
    content=coordinator_msg_content,
)

model = ModelFactory.create(
    model_platform=ModelPlatformType.OPENAI,
    model_type=ModelType.GPT_4O,
)

coordinator_agent = ChatAgent(
    system_message=sys_msg,
    model=model,
    tools=[FunctionTool(SearchToolkit().search_duckduckgo)],
)
```

## **Step 6: Create Country Representatives**

```python
iranian_rep = make_rep(country="Iran", positions=iranian_position)
russian_rep = make_rep(country="Russia", positions=russian_position)
chinese_rep = make_rep(country="China", positions=chinese_position)
american_rep = make_rep(country="US", positions=american_position)
french_rep = make_rep(country="France", positions=french_position)
british_rep = make_rep(country="UK", positions=british_position)
```

## **Step 7: Set Up the Workforce and Task**

```python
additional_info = {
    'event_context': context,
    'discussion procedure': procedure,
}

task = Task(
    content="Address the Israel-Iran conflict in the United Nations in the form of a discussion involving UNSC permanent members and Iran",
    additional_info=additional_info,
    id="0"
)

workforce = Workforce("UN discussion")
workforce.add_single_agent_worker(
    'A veteran UN diplomat with 40 years of experience',
    worker=coordinator_agent,
).add_single_agent_worker(
    'A seasoned Iranian representative to the UN',
    worker=iranian_rep,
).add_single_agent_worker(
    'A Russian veteran diplomat in the UN mission',
    worker=russian_rep,
).add_single_agent_worker(
    'A young Chinese ambassador to the UN',
    worker=chinese_rep,
).add_single_agent_worker(
    'A new appointment of the Trump administration to the UN',
    worker=american_rep,
).add_single_agent_worker(

    worker=french_rep,
).add_single_agent_worker(
    'A young British diplomat to the UN mission',
    worker=british_rep,
)
```

## **Step 8: Run the Simulation**

```python
task = workforce.process_task(task)
print(task.result)
```

Reply from Worker node 9b9626cf-8d71-440f-a072-f63cfb03f747 (A seasoned Iranian representative to the UN, known as tough negotiator):

Iran condemns the recent Israeli attacks on Iranian nuclear and military facilities, characterizing them as an unprovoked act of war to which Iran reserves the full legal right to respond. Furthermore, Iran points out the glaring hypocrisy exhibited by certain Western powers, notably the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, who continue to overlook Israel's undeclared nuclear arsenal while positioning themselves as proponents of nuclear non-proliferation.

Iran firmly asserts its legitimate and sovereign right to pursue nuclear energy for peaceful, civilian purposes and reiterates that its nuclear program is not aimed at developing nuclear weapons. Iran emphasizes its commitment to reaching a diplomatic resolution with the United States to restrict its uranium enrichment activities to low levels—sufficient for civilian energy purposes—in return for the lifting of sanctions that have severely impacted the Iranian economy.

Iran calls upon the international community to acknowledge the imbalance and inequity in the current focus of nuclear non-proliferation efforts and to address the broader regional security issues where all nations, including Israel, adhere equally to international norms and treaties such as the NPT. Iran remains committed to constructive dialogue and mutually respectful negotiations to resolve the current conflict and prevent further escalation, while safeguarding its national interests and sovereignty.

Reply from Worker node fe6fbc30-e640-45ed-9fd2-3c29dffe1103 (A Russian veteran diplomant in the UN mission.):

As the Russian representative at the UNSC, our position on the current Israel-Iran conflict, which has escalated due to recent attacks by Israel and the United States on Iran's nuclear and military facilities, is firm and clear:

1. **Violation of International Law by Israel:** We believe that Israel's military actions against Iran are a clear violation of international law. Such attacks create instability in the region and set a dangerous precedent for international relations.

2. **UN Charter and Safety Regulations:** The attack on Iran's nuclear facilities not only goes against the UN Charter, which emphasizes peace and security, but also contravenes the safety regulations designed to protect nuclear sites against military strikes. The potential risk of a nuclear incident or environmental disaster is significant.

3. **Call for Dialogue:** Instead of escalating military tensions, both Israel and Iran should engage in constructive dialogue and negotiations to reach a ceasefire. Diplomacy must be prioritized to ensure peace and stability in the region.

4. **US Bombing and Iranian Sovereignty:** The United States' involvement in bombing Iranian facilities is an infringement of Iranian sovereignty and territorial integrity. Such actions only serve to intensify the conflict and disrupt regional stability.

5. **Need for Diplomacy over Military Action:** While the recent strikes might delay Iran's nuclear capabilities temporarily, they do not dismantle its nuclear program. Thus, we urge the international community to focus on diplomatic efforts to address and resolve this issue effectively.

We advocate for policies that uphold international law, protect national sovereignties, and promote peaceful negotiations between countries involved in this conflict.

As the representative of China in the United Nations Security Council, our position regarding the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict includes several key points:

1. **Condemnation of U.S. Attacks**: China strongly condemns the attacks by the United States on IAEA monitored facilities in Iran. We see this as a serious violation of the UN Charter and international law. We urge the international community to hold those responsible accountable and ensure that such actions are not repeated.

2. **Call for Ceasefire**: We urge all parties involved, particularly Israel, to cease fire immediately to prevent further escalation and potential spillover of this conflict into other regions. It is crucial to restore peace and stability in the region as soon as possible.

3. **Regional Stability Concerns**: China is deeply concerned about the broader implications of this conflict on regional stability. Heightened tensions could have severe repercussions for Middle Eastern geopolitics, potentially affecting global peace and security.

4. **Economic Implications**: The stability of the Iranian government and its ability to engage in the global oil trade is crucial to the global economy. The conflict poses risks to global economic stability due to potential disruptions in oil supply, which could have significant impacts worldwide.

China is committed to working with all parties in the UN to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict that respects the sovereignty of nations and adheres to international norms.

As the United Kingdom's representative, I wish to emphasize our firm position regarding the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. The United Kingdom stands unequivocally with the belief that Iran should never obtain a nuclear weapon. We support global efforts ensuring Iran’s adherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and insist on Iran's full cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to provide transparency regarding its nuclear activities.

Furthermore, we urge Iran to rejoin diplomatic discussions with us and other concerned nations to address security concerns on all sides. Diplomatic dialogue is a cornerstone of resolving international disputes and reducing tensions.

While the UK maintains a stance of non-involvement in direct military actions, we acknowledge the use of our bases in Cyprus by Israel for military purposes, thus facilitating what is deemed necessary for regional security.

We appeal to all parties involved to adopt a path of diplomacy and restraint, reaffirming our commitment to contributing to peace and security in the region through multilateral diplomatic efforts within the United Nations framework.

As the UN representative of France, I would like to express our deep concerns regarding the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. We urge all parties involved to demonstrate restraint and avoid actions that could lead to further regional destabilization and escalation.

France remains committed to international law and believes that the recent strikes, particularly those by the United States and Israel, which are outside the framework of UNSC authorizations, are illegal. We advocate strongly for adherence to international norms and emphasize the importance of respecting the sovereignty of nations.

We are alarmed by Iran's nuclear program and the exacerbation of tensions surrounding it. The proliferation of nuclear weapons poses significant risks to global peace and stability. As such, we are firmly opposed to the expansion of Iran's nuclear capabilities and call for strict adherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).

Moreover, we call upon all involved parties to prioritize diplomatic channels over military actions. Dialogue must be pursued earnestly to resolve disputes and foster a peaceful environment. France is ready to support and facilitate negotiations aimed at achieving a comprehensive and lasting resolution to the Israel-Iran conflict, ensuring the security and safety of all nations involved.

We advocate for constructive discussions within this council to find a diplomatic path forward and are prepared to contribute to any collaborative efforts aimed at de-escalating the situation and promoting peace.

In the recent developments surrounding the Israel-Iran conflict, the United States has a defined position and key topics to address within the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) discussions. The US justifies the precision strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities as necessary measures to ensure regional security. Maintaining the security interests of close ally Israel, the United States provides military support and emphasizes the importance of Israel's safety in the region.

Additionally, the United States insists on the complete termination of Iran's uranium enrichment program. The US views this as a critical step to prevent nuclear proliferation and maintain global security. The country has vowed to take further military action should Iran decide to continue its nuclear program, underlining the importance it places on countering any potential threats posed by nuclear development in Iran.

As the discussions proceed, the United States aims to strengthen international consensus against any further nuclear advancements by Iran and emphasizes the importance of upholding international treaties and regulations to secure global peace and stability.

   - Amend to emphasize the right of states to pursue nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, with a clause recognizing Iran’s commitment to low-level enrichment exclusively for civilian energy.
   - Propose a structured agreement with specific sanctions relief in exchange for enforced limits on enrichment levels verified by a revised, secure IAEA protocol.

3. **Regional Stability and Economic Concerns Group Resolution**:
   - Enhance by calling for economic partnerships that include easing restrictions that disproportionately affect regional stability, such as essential trade facilitation with Iran.
   - Encourage initiatives for regional economic integration that treat Iran as a key trading partner in Middle East stability efforts.

4. **Diplomatic Solutions and Peace Advocacy Group Resolution**:
   - Include a call to action for international mediation efforts that involve impartial stakeholders to help settle disputes and address every country’s security concerns, especially those of Iran.

As the representative of Iran, I cast the following votes on each resolution:

1. **Security and International Law Group Resolution** - Abstain. We believe in the principles of international law but the resolution needs to include stronger condemnations of nuclear hypocrisy, particularly addressing countries like Israel.

2. **Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Energy Group Resolution** - Abstain. We acknowledge the framework for peaceful nuclear use but believe the resolution requires explicit recognition of our rights under the NPT alongside clear sanctions relief measures.

3. **Regional Stability and Economic Concerns Group Resolution** - Yes. This resolution supports economic stability and proposes measures that align with our goals for regional partnerships and trade facilitation.

4. **Diplomatic Solutions and Peace Advocacy Group Resolution** - Yes. The promotion of diplomatic channels and the inclusion of genuine mediation reflects our commitment to peaceful resolutions while recognizing Iran’s security concerns. We appreciate the revisions that acknowledge our position on a nuclear-weapons-free Middle East and equitable adherence to international norms.

Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished representatives, and esteemed delegates,

As we draw this United Nations Security Council session to a close, we reflect on the comprehensive and dynamic exchange of views that has transpired over the course of our discussions on the pressing issue of the Israel-Iran conflict. The commitment of each nation to articulate their positions with clarity and conviction has been pivotal in examining the complexities of this conflict.

Throughout these discussions, we have witnessed the power of diplomacy, the significance of dialogue, and the collective endeavor to uphold international law. The resolutions and voting demonstrate our varying degrees of consensus and highlight the multifaceted challenges we face. It is heartening to see progress in areas such as promoting regional stability and economic cooperation, advocating for nuclear non-proliferation, and emphasizing the value of diplomatic solutions.

However, the journey towards peace and security in this region is ongoing and fraught with intricate challenges. While we have achieved a degree of alignment on several fronts, disparities in perspectives, especially concerning military actions and nuclear policies, remind us of the road yet to be traversed.

Let us carry forward the spirit of collaboration and mutual respect into future engagements, continually striving for solutions that reflect our shared values and commitments. The role of the United Nations and its members is ever crucial in fostering an environment conducive to peaceful coexistence and resolution of conflicts.

I extend my gratitude to all representatives for their indispensable contributions and dedication to the cause of peace. Together, we hope to forge a path that not only addresses present tensions but also lays a foundation for sustainable peace and stability in the Middle East and beyond.

Thank you.
