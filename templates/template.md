abstract: |
  This paper presents a novel framework for evaluating safety alignment in multi-agent AI systems. 
  We introduce a benchmark suite of long-horizon tasks that test both capability and safety alignment 
  in collaborative and competitive environments. Our results demonstrate that current alignment 
  techniques provide insufficient guarantees in multi-agent settings, and we propose new methods 
  that significantly improve safety outcomes without compromising task performance.

## Introduction

The rapid advancement of multi-agent AI systems has created new challenges for safety alignment. 
While single-agent alignment has received significant attention, multi-agent environments introduce 
emergent behaviors that can bypass existing safety measures...

## Methodology

Our approach combines reinforcement learning with safety constraints and introduces a novel 
evaluation metric that balances task completion with alignment preservation...

## Results

We evaluated our framework on three benchmark environments and found that our method reduces 
safety violations by 47% compared to baseline approaches while maintaining competitive task 
performance...

## Conclusion

This work highlights the critical need for specialized safety evaluation in multi-agent systems 
and provides a foundation for future research in this area...
